# 8PuzzleGenerator
Rudimentary code made to generate input for my 8 Puzzle Solver

This code was made for ECE 579 at the University of Arizona

I'm writing an A* 8-puzzle solving program and my homework required input sets with very specific difficulty requirements.
I figured why not make a computer do it for me. I'm entirely new to Java, so I'm certain this is wildly inelegant. Hopefully my classmates find this and also get some use out of it.
